# Reading time test app

This application is built for a study/paper I was working in for the course Student Conference given at department of Computing Science at Ume√• University.

## The application
This application is built with Pug (Previously known as Jade), vanilla JS, CSS and Node.JS (with Express) to be able to present texts, generate forms and measure the time test subjects spend on reading the texts.

#### How to run
First, run:
```
npm install
```
to install all dependencies.

To run the application:
I prefer to use [Nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon), if you have it:
```
nodemon server.js
```
otherwise:
```
node server.js
```

## The study
The scientific question I present for the study is "Does replacing words with emojis affect the reading time of texts?" and I do this since with the rise in popularity and easier access to use emojis I think it is important to investigate their effect on reading times. Especially with the new features in iOS 10 that makes it very easy to replace words with emojis.  

## The course
The goal of the course is to give knowledge about a new or expansive area within Computing Science that has practical or theoretical relevance for a special application or applications in general. The course has the form of a conference, to provide a realistic environment. Another goal is that the student will develop his/her abilities to: make independent investigations and research into an interesting topic; write a scientific report about his/her work; and present his/her research orally.
